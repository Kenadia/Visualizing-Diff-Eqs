A program for the visualization of differential equations in three different ways:
  - slope field
  - juxtaposed displays of Euler's method
  - color gradient

The program will parse equations typed into a field, and has many controls to adjust the output. Try it out by running dist/Differential.jar, and make sure that lib/ is in the same directory as the JAR file.
